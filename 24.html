              <p class="lead"><b>Fitrah: The Quintessence of Spiritual Truth in a World Adrift</b></p>
              <p>In a world beset by myriad woes and seemingly insurmountable challenges, we must never lose sight of the guiding principles that have been bestowed upon us by the Divine. The Quran, the sacred scripture of Islam, reminds us of the paramount importance of preserving the fitrah, or the naturalistic way of life, which encompasses the mind, body, and soul. This essential truth, the core of all religions, can be found in verse 30:30, which proclaims, "There is no changing Allah's creation. That is the true Deen."<br><br>
              As we examine the profundity of these words, we come to understand that the supreme law of the Almighty is to maintain the harmony and balance of His creation. This wisdom can be further discerned in verses 4:119-122, where the pitfalls of succumbing to the temptations of Shaytan, or the Devil, are laid bare. Those who heed the malevolent whispers of Shaytan will find themselves led astray, their hearts filled with false hopes and their actions resulting in the desecration of Allah's creation. These misguided souls, choosing Shaytan as their protector, will ultimately find themselves bereft of solace and condemned to an eternity in the inferno of Hell.<br><br>
              Yet, there remains hope for those who embrace faith and righteousness. By adhering to the tenets of Islam, and indeed, the core principles of all religions, these individuals will find themselves welcomed into the Gardens of Paradise, where rivers flow and they shall dwell in everlasting bliss. This is the ultimate promise of Allah, a promise that rings true and unwavering, for who could speak more truly than the Creator Himself?<br><br>
              It is in the midst of such trying circumstances that we bear witness to an age of unparalleled scientific and technological advancements. The world has seen many a marvel unfold before its very eyes, bringing forth a sense of awe and wonderment. Yet, amidst the dazzling splendor of progress and the promise of an ever-brightening tomorrow, there lurks a hidden darkness, a sinister undercurrent wherein the shadows of greed and power creep and conspire. With heavy hearts and furrowed brows, we must cast our gaze upon such nefarious machinations, for the very essence of humanity hangs in the balance, teetering on the precipice between enlightenment and ruin.<br><br></p>

              <p class="lead"><b>The Darkness Lurking Beneath the Splendor: <br>The Perils of Scientific Progress and the Human Condition</b></p>
              <p>As we tread this path of progress, we find ourselves faced with a myriad of possibilities, both wondrous and woeful. Each stride towards a brighter future casts a shadow, a sinister reflection of the potential for misuse and corruption. It is within these shadows that the powerful few may seek to usurp the many, turning the instruments of progress into tools of oppression and control.<br><br>
              As we tread this path of progress, we find ourselves faced with a myriad of possibilities, both wondrous and woeful. Each stride towards a brighter future casts a shadow, a sinister reflection of the potential for misuse and corruption. It is within these shadows that the powerful few may seek to usurp the many, turning the instruments of progress into tools of oppression and control.<br><br>
              These moments of triumph for humankind, when our capabilities surge forth into uncharted territories, carry with them a great responsibility. We must remain vigilant and steadfast in our pursuit of knowledge, always wary of those who would twist the fruits of our labors to serve their own nefarious ends. For it is in the unseen recesses of our achievements that the greatest threats to our collective future may lie.<br><br>
              The elite, emboldened by the power afforded them by the advancements in mRNA technology and PCR tests, may now cast their eyes upon the very building blocks of life itself. Like wolves circling their prey, they stalk the sanctity of our genetic makeup, seeking to claim it as their own and subjugate humanity to their whims. It is a grim reminder that, as we reach ever further into the unknown, we must guard ourselves against the darkness that lurks within the very heart of human ambition.<br><br>
              For in this age of wonders and terrors, we stand upon a precipice. One misstep, one unchecked abuse of the powers we have wrought, and we may find ourselves tumbling into an abyss from which there is no return. We must, therefore, hold fast to the principles of freedom and individual liberty, ensuring that the light of progress ever banishes the shadows of tyranny and greed.<br><br></p>

              <p class="lead"><b>The Double-Edged Sword of Progress: <br>Boundless Ingenuity and the Looming Peril of Elite Exploitation</b></p>
              <p>And so we arrive at the crux of our present conundrum: the double-edged sword of progress, wherein boundless ingenuity and the looming peril of elite exploitation coexist in uneasy tension. Indeed, these days bear witness to a seemingly boundless human ingenuity. In the realm of science, the wonder of mRNA technology and PCR tests has left many agog. Yet, as with all great power, it is not without its peril, for the temptation to harness such advancements for ill gains has proven too great for some among the global elite.<br><br>
              As the curtain of scientific discovery is pulled back, revealing a vast expanse of possibility, the specter of greed and unbridled ambition hovers ever close, a constant reminder of the duality of progress. For it is in these moments of triumph that the seeds of our undoing may be sown, should we allow the machinations of the powerful few to twist the gifts of knowledge to serve their own dark desires.<br><br>
              Recent whispers speak of a sinister manipulation of human DNA through the very same mRNA technology that promised healing and hope. With twisted ambition, these nefarious actors are said to toy with our very genetic makeup, rendering it their own, and effectively reducing those affected to the status of modern-day chattel. By claiming copyright on the newly modified DNA, or cDNA, the global elite would hold dominion over the very fabric of an individual's existence, exploiting them for their own malicious ends.<br><br>
              Such a harrowing prospect beckons us to stand steadfast in defense of the values that underpin the very essence of our humanity. We must cast a wary eye upon these developments, ever vigilant in our protection of the principles of freedom and individual liberty. For as we stride forward into the unknown, we must ensure that we do not leave behind the very moral compass that has guided us thus far.<br><br>
              In the face of such looming threats, we must unite as a society, standing shoulder to shoulder in defiance of those who would seek to exploit our advancements for their own sinister purposes. We must ensure that the fire of progress burns bright, illuminating the path before us while casting the shadows of exploitation and tyranny to the wayside. For it is in the balance of these dual forces that the future of our species, and the very essence of our humanity, will be decided.<br><br></p>

With twisted ambition, these nefarious actors are said to toy with our very genetic makeup, rendering it their own, and effectively reducing those affected to the status of modern-day chattel. By claiming copyright on the newly modified DNA, or cDNA, the global elite would hold dominion over the very fabric of an individual's existence, exploiting them for their own malicious ends.<br><br>
              As the tendrils of this dark scheme unfurl, they threaten to ensnare the very soul of humanity. With each step taken down this treacherous path, we risk surrendering our most cherished values to the insatiable appetite of avarice. The machinations of the global elite, driven by their lust for power, would rend asunder the bonds of our collective dignity, leaving naught but the hollow echoes of once-vibrant dreams.<br><br>
              Such wicked deeds strike at the very core of the principles of freedom and individual liberty, for they seek to undermine the sanctity of our natural rights. In the realm of science, the patenting of cDNA is a vile perversion of its purpose, turning a bastion of knowledge and progress into a tool of oppression. This heinous act betrays the spirit of scientific inquiry, casting a pall over the nobility of discovery and perverting the sacred trust between those who seek knowledge and those who stand to benefit from its fruits.<br><br>
              As the specter of this unconscionable exploitation looms large, we must find within ourselves the fortitude to confront it head-on. We must wield the torch of reason, illuminating the shadows of deception and casting out the darkness that threatens to consume us. For only through the unyielding defense of our most sacred ideals can we hope to vanquish the insidious forces that seek to subvert the very essence of our being.<br><br></p>

            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>A Call to Arms: <br>Defending the Hallowed Grounds of Freedom and Liberty</b></p>
              <p>As we gaze upon this bleak horizon, we must not surrender ourselves to despair. Rather, let us summon forth the courage of our forebears, who braved the tempests of tyranny and injustice with the conviction that truth and righteousness would prevail. For it is in the crucible of adversity that the true measure of our character is revealed, and we must prove ourselves worthy of the legacy bequeathed to us by those who came before.<br><br>
              It is now more imperative than ever that we hold steadfast to the principles of freedom and liberty, and stand in defiance against such abominable violations. The time has come to hold these contemptible actors to account, ensuring that the threads of our genetic code remain unshackled from the influence of any individual or group. By uniting in common cause, we may yet cast down the chains of oppression and reclaim the birthright that is our shared humanity.<br><br>
              Let us, therefore, join our voices in a clarion call for justice, demanding transparency and accountability from those who would seek to wield the power of science for their own malevolent ends. With unyielding resolve, we must safeguard the sacred principles that have long served as the bedrock of our society, and ensure that the gifts of knowledge and progress are harnessed for the benefit of all, rather than the caprice of a privileged few. In so doing, we shall stand as a beacon of hope, illuminating the path to a brighter, more equitable future for generations to come.<br><br></p>

            <p>It is now more imperative than ever that we hold steadfast to the principles of freedom and liberty, and stand in defiance against such abominable violations. The time has come to hold these contemptible actors to account, ensuring that the threads of our genetic code remain unshackled from the influence of any individual or group.<br><br>
            As we march forth on this noble quest, let us bear in mind the ever-present need for vigilance in the face of emerging threats. We must not allow ourselves to be lulled into complacency, for it is in the unguarded moments that the seeds of tyranny are sown. It is our solemn duty to keep watch over the sanctity of our individual rights, guarding them with the same fervor as the ancient sentinels who stood resolute against the encroachment of darkness.<br><br>
            In tandem with the manipulation of our DNA, there arises the specter of PCR tests as a harbinger of pandemic. Detractors argue that these tests, absent the isolation and purification of the virus, lack the precision required for such a grave task. Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR technique, himself denounced its use for virus detection, deeming it an ill-suited instrument for diagnosing disease. This revelation further underscores the urgency of maintaining ethical standards and transparency in the practice of science and medicine, lest we allow the noble pursuit of knowledge to be perverted into an instrument of oppression and deceit.<br><br>
            Thus, as we raise our collective voices in defense of our cherished principles, let us also remain steadfast in our commitment to truth and justice. We must scrutinize the tools and methods employed in the name of progress, and ensure that they serve the betterment of humanity, rather than the machinations of a select few. By standing united in the face of adversity, we shall prevail in our struggle against the forces of darkness, and preserve the precious liberties that have been the lifeblood of our civilization for generations.<br><br></p>

Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR technique, himself denounced its use for virus detection, deeming it an ill-suited instrument for diagnosing disease.<br><br>
            The concerns surrounding these PCR tests cast a chilling shadow over the realm of scientific inquiry, drawing attention to the potential for abuse and deception.
