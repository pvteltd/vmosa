          When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to reaffirm their connection to the natural world and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, the preservation and protection of the environment, the equal rights of all living beings, and the responsible stewardship of our shared resources, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to this commitment.<br><br>
          We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all beings are interconnected, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Harmony with Nature. To secure these rights, institutions and societies are established among humans, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, and founded upon the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God.<br><br>
          The history of the present age is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over the natural world. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world, and let us remember our sacred duty to honor and abide by the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God, as we strive to create a more harmonious and sustainable future for all living beings.<br><br>
