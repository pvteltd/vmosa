            Section 1: The Negation (لا إله)<br><br>
            To safeguard and promote minority and natural rights, ensuring that the power of civil disobedience is protected and maintained for the benefit of all.<br><br>
            Section 2: The Affirmation (إلا الله)<br><br>
            The natural liberty of humanity is to be free from any superior power on Earth and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man. The preservation of natural liberty as a fundamental right of all individuals, as provided in verses 60:8-9.<br><br>
            Section 3: Muhammad as the Messenger of Natural Rights (محمد رسول الله)<br><br>
            Recognizing the traits of Muhammad, as described in the Quran, as a symbol of advocacy for natural rights and as guidance for evaluating leadership qualifications based on the highest expectation of fulfilling the condition precedent لا إله.<br><br>
            a) Unity and Oneness:<br><br>
            Understanding that the Law of Nature, Nature's God, prophets, rasuls, believers of natural law, or the naturalists are considered "One Nation"; regardless of their beliefs, and that allegiance to these principles is, in fact, allegiance to the unity of a just and harmonious world. This unity One God/Good is essential for fostering an inclusive approach to the pursuit of natural rights, justice, and harmony, embracing individuals from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.<br><br>
            b) No Distinction:<br><br>
            Acknowledging that there should be no distinction made between the teachings of various prophets, rasuls, believers of natural law, or the naturalists in the context of natural rights. This understanding fosters an inclusive approach to the pursuit of One God/Good, natural rights, justice, and harmony, embracing individuals from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.<br><br>
            c) Avoiding Division:<br><br>
            Recognizing the importance of avoiding divisions among those who uphold the principles of natural rights and those who reject them. The true goal is to strive for unity and harmony in upholding the principles of natural law and promoting One God/Good or natural rights for all.<br><br>
            d) Common Ground and Collaboration:<br><br>
            Inviting people of different belief systems and legal traditions to find common ground in the shared pursuit of One God/Good, natural rights, justice, and harmony. This approach encourages collaboration and mutual understanding, fostering a more inclusive and respectful ecological justice for all.<br><br>
            e) Implementing the Principles:<br><br>
            Emphasizing the importance of implementing the principles of natural rights, as described in the Quranic teachings; Surah 103 and verses 30:30, 11:17 and 12:108, in order to establish a strong foundation for a just and harmonious world. By adhering to these principles, individuals and societies can work together to create a just and harmonious world, free from the divisions and conflicts that arise from rejecting the common values of natural law.<br><br>
