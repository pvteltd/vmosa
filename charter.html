          <h1 class="display-huge">Our Charter</h1>
          When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to reaffirm their connection to the natural world and to assume among the powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle them, the preservation and protection of the environment, the equal rights of all living beings, and the responsible stewardship of our shared resources, a decent respect to the opinions of humankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to this commitment.<br><br>
          We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all beings are interconnected, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Harmony with Nature. To secure these rights, institutions and societies are established among humans, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, and founded upon the Laws of Nature and Nature's God.<br><br>
          The history of the present age is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over the natural world. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world, and let us remember our sacred duty to honor and abide by the Laws of Nature and Nature's God, as we strive to create a more harmonious and sustainable future for all living beings.<br><br>

            <p><b>Article 1: Fundamental Principles</b></p>
            <p><b>(1) The Negation (لا إله)</b></p>
            To fortify and advance minority and natural rights through social distancing, assuring that the potency of civil disobedience is preserved and sustained for the common welfare.<br><br>
            (a) Social distancing in verses 60:4, 58:22, and 3:28: Encouraging the practice of withdrawing oneself from those who violate these fundamental principles.<br><br>
            (b) Moral absolutism in the Law of Persons: Focusing on the connections amongst individuals and the safeguarding of their intrinsic rights, encompassing freewill and freedom.<br><br>
            (i) Moral absolutism in the protection of freewill: Advocating for each person's inherent right to make choices and abide by their beliefs and values.<br><br>
            (ii) Moral absolutism in the protection of freedom: Defending each individual's liberty to exercise their rights without undue interference or coercion.<br><br>
            (c) Moral absolutism in the Law of Property: Attending to the rights and responsibilities related to property ownership and the preservation of cultural heritage.<br><br>
            (i) Special race-based/natives privileges and moral absolutism in the preservation of culture: Recognizing the unique rights and privileges of native and indigenous communities, and ensuring the safeguarding and promotion of their cultural heritage.<br><br>
            (ii) Special race-based/natives privileges and moral absolutism in the preservation of land ownership: Maintaining the rights of native and indigenous communities to possess and manage their ancestral lands.<br><br>
            (d) Moral absolutism in the Law of Obligations: Considering the duties and responsibilities individuals bear towards each other and society, with an emphasis on the protection of minority rights and the promotion of civil disobedience.<br><br>
            (i) Moral absolutism in the preservation of minority rights: Securing the rights and well-being of minority communities, ensuring they receive fair and equitable treatment.<br><br>
            (ii) Moral absolutism in the preservation of civil disobedience: Endorsing the right to resist unjust laws or actions through peaceful and non-violent means.<br><br>
            <p><b>(2) The Affirmation (إلا الله)</b></p>
            The natural liberty of humanity entails freedom from any superior power on Earth and exemption from the will or legislative authority of man. The conservation of natural liberty as an essential right of all individuals, as stipulated in verses 60:8-9.<br><br>
            <p><b>(3) Muhammad as the Messenger of Natural Rights<br>(محمد رسول الله)</b></p>
            Acknowledging the attributes of Muhammad, as portrayed in the Quran, as an emblem of advocacy for natural rights and as guidance for assessing leadership qualifications based on the utmost expectation of fulfilling the condition precedent<br> إلا الله لا إله.<br><br>
            (a) Unity and Oneness<br>
            Perceiving that the Law of Nature, Nature's God, prophets, rasuls, believers of natural law, or the naturalists are considered "One Nation"; regardless of their beliefs, and that allegiance to these principles is, in fact, allegiance to the unity of a just and harmonious world. This unity in One God/Good is essential for fostering an inclusive approach to the pursuit of natural rights, justice, and harmony, embracing individuals from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.<br><br>
            (b) No Distinction<br>
            Acknowledging that there should be no distinction made between the teachings of various prophets, rasuls, believers of natural law, or the naturalists in the context of natural rights. This understanding fosters an inclusive approach to the pursuit of One God/Good, natural rights, justice, and harmony, embracing individuals from diverse backgrounds and beliefs.<br><br>
            (a) Avoiding Division<br>
            Recognizing the importance of avoiding divisions among those who uphold the principles of natural rights and those who reject them. The true goal is to strive for unity and harmony in upholding the principles of natural law and promoting One God/Good or natural rights for all.<br><br>
            (d) Common Ground and Collaboration<br>
            Inviting people of different belief systems and legal traditions to find common ground in the shared pursuit of One God/Good, natural rights, justice, and harmony. This approach encourages collaboration and mutual understanding, fostering a more inclusive and respectful ecological justice for all.<br><br>
            (e) Implementing the Principles<br>
            Emphasizing the importance of implementing the principles of natural rights, as described in the Quranic teachings; Surah 103 and verses 30:30, 11:17, and 12:108, in order to establish a strong foundation for a just and harmonious world. By adhering to these principles, individuals and societies can work together to create a just and harmonious world, free from the divisions and conflicts that arise from rejecting the common values of natural law.<br><br>
