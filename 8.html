          <p class="lead pt-2 py-vh-2">
          FIRST PART: <br><br>
          Introduction: The Fascination with Divine Kingship<br><br>
          Within the rich tapestry of Islamic tradition, there exists a thread of divine kingship that has captivated the hearts and minds of scholars and believers alike. This humble narrative seeks to explore the possibility of messengers, entrusted with a sacred covenant, emerging after Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and fulfilling the promises of God as recorded in the Quran. It is said that these virtuous messengers shall inherit the Earth as part of the divine kingship.<br><br>
          The Chronicles of Messengers Post-Muhammad: Unveiling God's Intention<br><br>
          The Quran, that venerable tome of wisdom, contains within its pages the promises of God concerning divine kingship. These sacred passages reveal God's intention to appoint a leader on Earth who shall enact His divine will and uphold His celestial laws; 2:30, 21:105, 24:55, 3:33, 2:124, 6:161-163, 2:151, 6:157-158, 3:68, 10:47.<br><br>
          Section 1: Witnesses for "Earth Justice"<br><br>
          The Quran makes clear that there are messengers not mentioned in its verses (4:164) and that every nation has its own messenger (10:47). Prophets and messengers, including those who arise after Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), are to act as witnesses for "Earth Justice" (33:45). They have seen, heard, and felt the divine truth themselves (5:117).<br><br>
          Section 2: Messengers Before and After Muhammad<br><br>
          According to verses 28:75 and 16:89, every nation, before, during, and after the time of Muhammad, shall have a witness from among their own people. These messengers may not speak Arabic, as they communicate in the language of their people (14:4). Furthermore, the Quran states that there are "foremost" prophets and messengers, with some arising after Muhammad (56:10-14).<br><br>
          Section 3: The Role of Messengers in Punishment<br><br>
          Verses 17:58, 28:59, and 17:15-16 confirm that God sends a messenger before the destruction or punishment of a town. This indicates that messengers may continue to emerge in the future, guiding humanity along the path of righteousness.<br><br>
          The Realization of God's Promised Kingdom: Through Messengers<br><br>
          In this perspective, the divine kingship that God has promised shall be accomplished through the messengers who succeed Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). These chosen individuals shall endeavor to create a just and equitable society, adhering to the tenets of Islam and in compliance with God's divine laws. In so doing, they shall fulfill the promise of divine kingship, inheriting the Earth and ensuring the execution of God's will.<br><br>
          Conclusion: Faith and Deeds for a Just and Righteous Society<br><br>
          The concept of divine kingship and the potential emergence of messengers following Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) presents a captivating lens through which to view the continuity of divine leadership in Islam. While not universally embraced, this perspective offers a distinctive interpretation of Quranic verses and invites further inquiry and discourse on the subject. Ultimately, the realization of God's promised divine kingship shall depend on the faith and deeds of believers, who are called upon to abide by God's divine laws and strive for a just and righteous society.<br><br></p>

            <p>The Realization of God's Promised Kingdom<br><br>
              SECOND PART: A Tale of Natural Enlightenment: The Praise of the Contract and the Preservation of Freewill in Surah Al-Fatihah<br><br>
              Surely, those who pledge allegiance to you/21:105/24:55 are pledging allegiance to GOD (48:10)<br><br>
              Introduction:<br><br>
              In the vast expanse of human understanding, there exists a delicate balance between the faculties of the mind and the faculties of perception. It is through this balance that mankind discerns the natural rights bestowed upon them, and the relationship between justice, freewill, and freedom. Surah Al-Fatihah, the opening chapter of the Quran, serves as a beacon of enlightenment, guiding the reader to a deeper appreciation of the divine contract and the virtues of a harmonious existence.<br><br>
              The Covenant of Perception and Understanding:<br><br>
              In the pursuit of justice and wisdom, the mind and the senses engage in a subtle dance, each relying upon the other to achieve clarity and comprehension. It is said that the brain and the eye may have a contractual relationship in which the brain has agreed to believe what the eye sees, but in return, the eye has agreed to look for what the brain wants. This delicate accord underpins the very essence of Surah Al-Fatihah, as the believer seeks guidance from the divine to navigate the complexities of the natural world.<br><br>
              The Preservation of Freewill and Freedom:<br><br>
              Through the verses of Surah Al-Fatihah, God reaffirms the sanctity of human freewill and freedom. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, He promises forgiveness to those who adhere to His divine commandments (58:22, 60:9 and the essence of the Divine Kingship). As Master of the Day of Judgment, God reminds us that we are free to choose, but not free from the consequences of our choices.<br><br>
              By serving and seeking help from Nature's God alone, believers embark upon the straight path (41:52-53). This path is illuminated by those who have been favored by God, individuals who follow the "Study Guides" provided in Surahs 96, 68, 73, and 74, and are rooted in the context of verses 6:74-83.<br><br>
              The Chosen Ones: The Path of Those Bestowed with Favors:<br><br>
              The Quran provides guidance on identifying the individuals and groups that have been bestowed with God's favors (3:33). These include:<br><br>
              1. Adam (20:115) - The first human, created by God.<br><br>
              2. Noah (37:83) - A prophet tasked with warning his people of God's impending wrath.<br><br>
              3. Abraham (2:124, 2:130-133) - A patriarch and prophet, whose descendants include numerous prophets and messengers.<br><br>
              4. People of Abraham (3:68) - The believers who follow the path of Abraham and his teachings.<br>
              - All rasuls and prophets (6:74-90) - The messengers and prophets sent by God throughout history.<br>
              - Prophet Muhammad (22:78, 6:161-162, 16:120-121) - The final prophet, who brought forth the Quran and its teachings.<br>
              - Naturalists/Ecospiritualists (22:78, 2:129, 2:151, 4:125) - Those who uphold and promote the natural balance of God's creation, including rasuls after Muhammad.<br><br>
              5. People of Imran (3:42) - Maryam and the jihad for women - The mother of Jesus, who represents the strength and courage of women in their pursuit of faith and devotion.<br><br>
              Conclusion:<br><br>
              In conclusion, Surah Al-Fatihah stands as a testament to the enduring relationship between mankind and the divine, extolling the virtues of justice, freewill, and freedom. Through the delicate balance of perception and understanding, the believer embarks on a journey of enlightenment, embracing the natural rights that underpin our existence. Guided by the divine contract, believers find solace and wisdom in the teachings of those who have been bestowed with God's favors, from the earliest prophets to the naturalists and ecospiritualists of today.<br><br>
              As we traverse the path of faith, we come to appreciate the profound interconnectedness of all aspects of creation, with each individual playing a unique role in upholding the delicate balance between the natural and spiritual realms. As Charles Dickens so eloquently penned, "It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."<br><br>
              Thus, Surah Al-Fatihah beckons us to contemplate our place in the grand tapestry of existence, urging us to seek guidance and solace in the divine contract that binds us all. In doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to justice, freewill, and freedom, striving to create a world that reflects the harmony and balance that God intended for all of His creation.<br><br></p>
