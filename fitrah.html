          <p><h1 class="display-huge">Deen al-Fitrah: The Natural Law School of Jurisprudence</h1>
          In this masterwork, we journey through a profound discourse of spiritual understanding, delving into the depths of the Deen al-Fitrah, the natural religion, as elucidated in the al-Quran. We cast a critical gaze upon the Deen al-Islam, finding it to be but a shadow of the true spiritual essence enshrined in the original messages of the Quran. We illuminate the way this elite-guided interpretation has eclipsed the Deen al-Fitrah and stifled the practice of Natural Law.<br><br>
          Over thirteen insightful sections, we explore the sacred corridors of divine understanding, unearthing the wisdom of the 99 divine names of Allah and establishing the foundations of Validity, Truth, and Soundness. We delve into the symbology of the classical elements - Fire, Air, Earth, and Water - revealing their roles as keys to understanding these divine attributes.<br><br>
          As we traverse the intricate tapestry of existence, we recognize the harmonious symphony of contracts between energies, offering an enlightening perspective on the universal laws of energy. We present the Deen al-Fitrah not merely as a set of laws or principles, but as a holistic way of life that integrates spiritual understanding, intellectual balance, and ethical action.<br><br>
          In the heart of this work, we shine a light on the Global Charter of Ecospirituality, a beacon calling humanity to unite under the Green State and establish a system based on the Deen al-Fitrah. We explore the principles of the gift economy, contrasting this natural law-based economic system with the current monetary system of enslavement.<br><br>
          Our journey culminates in an impassioned call to reestablish the natural order, to awaken the Deen al-Fitrah, and to return to a system of Common Law Jurisprudence. This discourse serves as an anthem for the resurgence of the Natural Law, a clarion call to those yearning for a world guided by the principles of truth, justice, and spiritual enlightenment.<br><br></p>

              <p class="lead"><b>I. The Covenant: A Solemn Pact with The Divine</b></p>
              <p>In the grand tapestry of existence, a golden thread weaves its way, marking a solemn pact between humanity and the Divine. It is no mere pledge; rather, it is a covenant, etched into the ethereal script of the Quran, in verse 7:172. The words resonate through the ages, a beacon that guides us on our journey of self-discovery and alignment with the Divine. It calls us, in our myriad forms and varying ways, to embark on a quest towards a higher understanding of our place in the grand scheme of the universe.<br><br>
              This covenant is not a mere agreement, hastily decided upon and carelessly adhered to. Rather, it is a contract of cosmic significance, imbued with divine gravity. It carries with it a trifecta of requirements, a triad of conditions that must be fulfilled for us to uphold our end of the divine bargain. These conditions are the cornerstones of our spiritual journey, the celestial compass points guiding our path towards divine alignment.<br><br>
              Yet, the journey upon which we have embarked is not an easy one. It calls for profound introspection and unwavering determination, for the path to divine understanding is strewn with the obstacles of ignorance and the pitfalls of misconception. It demands our full commitment, for it is not merely a part of our lives, but the very essence of our existence.<br><br>
              So let us set forth, dear reader, on this journey of discovery. Let us seek to understand the divine contract to which we are bound, to unravel the intricate layers of its requirements, to peel back the veils of obscurity that shroud its true meaning. Let us embark upon the grand adventure of understanding and fulfilling our divine covenant.<br><br>
              Let us now turn our attention to the first requirement of this sacred pact - the condition of Validity. As we move forward into the next chapter, we will delve into the depths of this concept, seeking to unravel its mysteries and understand its profound implications in the context of our divine journey.<br><br>
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>II. The First Requirement: Validity</b></p>
              <p>The second chapter in our journey brings us face to face with the first of these divine requirements: Validity. A concept seemingly simple, yet fraught with profound implications, it forms the bedrock of our spiritual journey. As detailed in verses 7:179-183, Validity calls for an understanding, nay, an intimate knowledge of the 99 divine names of Allah – the Asma ul Husna. Each of these names, these divine attributes, forms an integral part of our spiritual consciousness, a piece in the grand mosaic of our understanding of the Divine.<br><br>
              Imagine, dear reader, the profound transformation that comes with the full comprehension of being a creation of Al-Ghani, the All-Sufficient. Could we, wrapped in our humble mortal coils, then entertain feelings of poverty, of insufficiency? Surely not! For to understand Al-Ghani is to understand our inherent abundance, to recognise the wellspring of sufficiency that springs eternal within us.<br><br>
              Or consider what it means to acknowledge our creation by Al-Hakim, the All-Wise. How then, can thoughts of stupidity find lodging in our minds? How can we doubt our wisdom, when we are created by the very embodiment of all wisdom? Thus, each name, each divine attribute, becomes a beacon illuminating our path to validity, a lighthouse guiding us through the turbulent seas of ignorance and misconception.<br><br>
              These divine attributes, these 99 facets of the Divine, are not merely names. They are energies, universal laws, clear signs that guide us towards the fulfilment of our covenant, towards the attainment of validity in our divine contract. They are the keys to our spiritual evolution, the cornerstones upon which we build our understanding of our place in the grand cosmic scheme.<br><br>
              And so, we embark upon the journey of understanding these divine attributes, of aligning our energies with them, of attaining validity in our divine covenant. As we move forward into the next chapter, we delve deeper into the sea of divine wisdom, seeking to understand the intricate dance of energies and universal laws that govern our existence. We set forth on the path towards understanding the Law of Energy, towards unravelling the secrets of the Asma ul Husna.<br><br>

            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>III. The Second Requirement: Truth</b></p>
              <p>The third chapter of our narrative brings us to the doorstep of a concept as old as time itself, yet as fresh as the morning dew - Truth. The second requirement, the second cornerstone of our spiritual journey, Truth finds itself put to the test in Surah 103. In the relentless march of Time, where moments slip away like sand through the fingers, Truth emerges as an unyielding bastion, a sanctuary amidst the chaos.<br><br>
              Truth, dear reader, is not a mere abstraction, a philosophical curiosity to be toyed with in idle moments. It is as real as the earth beneath our feet, as tangible as the air we breathe. It is the rock that stands resolute amidst the tumultuous sea of life, the star that guides us through the darkest nights, the lighthouse that beckons us home through the stormiest seas.<br><br>
              But Truth is not just to be sought - it is to be embraced, to be lived. It is to be woven into the very fabric of our being, to become the lens through which we perceive the world. It is only through Truth, through living in accordance with the divine reality, that we can fulfil our divine covenant, that we can align ourselves with the cosmic rhythm.<br><br>
              And so, as we embark on the quest for Truth, we are not merely seeking an abstract principle. We are seeking to align ourselves with the divine order, to attune ourselves to the cosmic symphony. We are seeking to fulfil our divine covenant, to honour the sacred pact we made with the Divine.<br><br>
              As we journey forth into the next chapter of our spiritual narrative, we delve deeper into the essence of Truth, into the heart of the divine reality. We journey into the depths of the divine order, seeking to understand, to live, and to embody the Truth. For it is in Truth, and only in Truth, that we can fulfil our divine covenant, that we can truly understand and honour the sacred pact we made with the Divine. And so, with Truth as our compass, we set sail on the sea of divine wisdom, ready to brave the storm, ready to seek the divine light.<br><br>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>IV. The Third Requirement: Soundness</b></p>
              <p>Chapter IV of our tale, dear reader, introduces us to the third requirement of our divine covenant - Soundness. The final hurdle, the last piece of the puzzle, Soundness is tested through the prism of Divine Kingship.<br><br>
              But what, you may ask, does Soundness truly entail? It is not merely the absence of falsehood, the simple negation of deceit. No, it is far more profound, far more demanding. It is the active pursuit of righteousness, the relentless quest for the good, the unwavering commitment to the pursuit of justice. It is the affirmation of our understanding, the validation of our wisdom, the consummation of our spiritual journey.<br><br>
              Soundness, dear reader, is the fruit borne of the tree of wisdom, the testament of our understanding, the ultimate proof of our alignment with the divine order. It is the yardstick by which our understanding is measured, the crucible in which our wisdom is tested. It is the mirror that reflects the depth of our understanding, the scale that weighs the weight of our wisdom.<br><br>
              As we embark on the quest for Soundness, we are not merely seeking to avoid falsehood. We are seeking to actively pursue the good, to embody righteousness, to exemplify justice. We are seeking to prove the usefulness of our understanding, to demonstrate the practicality of our wisdom, to live out the principles of our divine covenant.<br><br>
              And so, as we set sail on the sea of divine wisdom, we do so with Soundness as our compass, with righteousness as our guide. We embark on the quest for Soundness with the knowledge that it is not merely about avoiding falsehood, but about actively pursuing the good, about living out the principles of our divine covenant. And with this knowledge, we are ready to face the challenges that lie ahead, ready to prove the Soundness of our understanding, ready to fulfill our divine covenant.<br><br>
              As we journey forth into the next chapter of our spiritual narrative, we delve deeper into the concept of Soundness, ready to face the challenges that lie ahead, ready to prove the Soundness of our understanding, ready to fulfill our divine covenant. And as we journey forth, we do so with the knowledge that Soundness is not merely about avoiding falsehood, but about actively pursuing the good, about living out the principles of our divine covenant. And with this knowledge, we are ready to face the challenges that lie ahead, ready to prove the Soundness of our understanding, ready to fulfill our divine covenant.<br><br>
              Thus, as we turn the page to the next chapter, we brace ourselves for a deeper exploration into the realm of Divine Kingship, a realm where Soundness is the guiding principle, the driving force, the ultimate goal. It is here where we shall put to test our understanding, our wisdom, and our commitment to the divine covenant. It is here where we shall find the true meaning of Soundness.<br><br>

              <p class="lead"><b>V. The Elements and The Divine Names</b></p>
              <p>Chapter V, my dear reader, brings us to a rather fascinating crossroads in our spiritual journey. It is here that we pose the question: How can we hope to comprehend the divine names and fulfill our solemn pact with the Almighty? The answer, believe it or not, lies in the very fabric of our existence - the classical elements of Fire, Air, Earth, and Water.<br><br>
              These elements, more than mere constituents of our physical world, are the keys to unlocking the mysteries of the divine names, the Asma ul Husna. Each element, in its raw, untamed state, offers a unique perspective, a different lens through which we can view the divine names. By assigning the divine names to these elements, we journey through different dimensions of understanding and insight, transcending the limitations of our mortal comprehension.<br><br>
              Fire, with its fierce, transformative energy, aligns with the divine names that encapsulate the Creator's power and might. Air, with its gentle, nurturing presence, mirrors the divine names that reflect God's wisdom and awareness. Earth, with its steadfast, nurturing nature, resonates with the divine names that speak of God's mercy and provision. And Water, with its tranquil, adaptable essence, embodies the divine names that convey God's peace and harmony.<br><br>
              By exploring the divine names through the lens of these elements, we not only deepen our understanding of the Asma ul Husna but also our understanding of ourselves and our place in this vast, intricate universe. It's a journey of discovery, of illumination, and of profound spiritual awakening.<br><br>
              As we close this chapter, we prepare to delve deeper into this remarkable exploration. We are about to embark on an expedition through the realm of Fire, unlocking its mysteries and aligning ourselves with the divine names that resonate with its mighty energy. So, gird your loins, dear reader, for the journey ahead promises to be a transformative one indeed.<br><br>

            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>VI. The Contract of Natural Selection</b></p>
              <p>Chapter VII presents us with a culminating concept, the Deen al-Fitrah, a school of jurisprudence that is more than just a compendium of laws and principles. It is, rather, an enlightening journey through the sacred corridors of divine understanding, a path that leads us to our true selves. It is not just a journey, but a revelation, an awakening.<br><br>
              The Deen al-Fitrah is an integrative way of life that unites spiritual understanding with intellectual balance and ethical action. It is the beacon that guides us towards the fulfillment of our divine covenant. It is the compass that keeps us aligned with the universe's natural laws, the blueprint that helps us construct a life of purpose and meaning.<br><br>
              As we walk this path, we begin to truly comprehend the divine names, the Asma ul Husna. We learn to see the world not just with our eyes, but with our hearts, our souls. We learn to discern the truth amidst the noise and chaos of life, to prove the soundness of our understanding through our actions and our character.<br><br>
              In the grand theatre of life, we are not just spectators, but active participants. We are co-creators of our reality, moulded by the divine energies that govern the universe. Through the Deen al-Fitrah, we learn to align ourselves with these energies, to resonate with their frequencies, to dance to their rhythm.<br><br>
              Dear reader, as we journey through life, let us not forget our sacred pact. Let us strive to understand the divine names, to walk in the light of truth, to prove the soundness of our understanding, and to live in harmony with the natural laws of the universe. Let us remember that our journey is not just about reaching a destination, but about the experiences we gather, the wisdom we accrue, and the transformation we undergo along the way.<br><br>
              As we close this chapter, we stand at the threshold of a new understanding, ready to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe. Onwards we journey, dear reader, into the depths of wisdom and understanding, into the heart of the divine.<br><br>

            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>VIII. The Fire of Divine Understanding</b></p>
              <p>Chapter VIII, dear reader, carries us further along our enlightened journey, introducing us to the realm of Fire - a mighty element symbolizing the divine names that encapsulate energy, transformation, and the illuminating power of truth. Fire, in its magnificent blaze, embodies a distinct duality: it can be the harbinger of destruction, and yet, in its elemental essence, it is a beacon of enlightenment.<br><br>
              Fire, you see, holds the power to burn away illusion, to sear through the veil of ignorance that often shrouds our mortal eyes. Just as the silversmith uses fire to purify silver, removing its impurities until he sees his own reflection, so too does the divine fire of understanding purify our minds, removing the dross of falsehood until truth shines forth in all its glory.<br><br>
              Consider, if you will, the element of Fire in the light of the contract of natural selection. It is the agent of transformation, turning the base into the precious, the ordinary into the extraordinary. Fire refines, purifies, and ultimately transforms - turning soils into gold, ignorance into wisdom.<br><br>
              As we delve into the depths of the divine names associated with Fire, we learn to embody their essence in our lives. We begin to form a clear distinction between fact and illusion, aligning the major and minor premises of our existence. In the crucible of life, we are the raw material, and the divine fire of understanding is the agent of our transformation.<br><br>
              As we surrender to the principles of natural selection, drawing closer to the divine names associated with Fire, we stoke the flames of our spiritual evolution. We learn to harness the transformative power of Fire, turning the base metal of our ignorance into the gold of wisdom.<br><br>
              And now, as the glow of divine understanding illuminates our path, we journey forth into the realm of Air, ready to experience its gentle yet profound influence on our spiritual journey. The dance of Fire and Air begins, a celestial ballet that will guide us towards a deeper understanding of our sacred covenant.<br><br>

            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>IX. The Air of Divine Wisdom</b></p>
              <p>Chapter IX, dear reader, invites us to turn our gaze skyward, to the realm of Air. A realm that embodies knowledge, wisdom, and awareness, represented by divine names that whisper in the wind, echo in the rustle of leaves, and resonate in the silent spaces between words. It is Air that carries the sound of divine wisdom to our ears, beckoning us to listen, to see, to understand.<br><br>
              Think of Air as the master craftsman, deftly shaping the gold of understanding that Fire has so ardently forged. It takes the raw, molten truth and cools it, molds it, and polishes it into a necklace of insight, ready to be worn with humility and grace. It is in the realm of Air that understanding matures into wisdom, and wisdom evolves into discernment.<br><br>
              The divine names associated with Air are our guides in this realm, our teachers in the school of wisdom. They are the winds that fill the sails of our intellectual ship, guiding us on our journey through the vast ocean of knowledge. They whisper secrets into our ears, revealing the mysteries of the universe one breath at a time.<br><br>
              As we immerse ourselves in the divine names of Air, we learn to see the world through the lens of wisdom. We learn to listen to the whispers of truth carried on the wind, to see the subtle signs of divine wisdom in the world around us.<br><br>
              But remember, dear reader, wisdom is not a destination, but a journey. A journey that leads us not just to knowledge, but to understanding, to empathy, to love. And as we journey forth, we prepare to descend from the heights of Air into the depths of Earth, ready to ground our wisdom in the rich soil of practical application. Let us carry the lessons of Air with us as we journey onward, for they will light our path in the world of Earth, illuminating the way to a deeper understanding of our sacred pact.<br><br>

            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>X. The Earth of Divine Creation</b></p>
              <p>Now, we arrive at the domain of Earth, the cradle of creation, the home of stability, and the mother of nurturing forces. This is where the divine names associated with creation, growth, and perseverance find their dwelling. We must understand the element of Earth not merely as the ground beneath our feet but as the grounding force within us, a sturdy foundation upon which our understanding of the divine names is anchored.<br><br>
              In the realm of Earth, dear reader, the abstract knowledge shaped by Fire and crafted by Air is given tangible form. It is here that wisdom takes root, and understanding blossoms into action. It is here that we learn the art of being, of aligning our lives with the divine attributes that form the fabric of our very existence.<br><br>
              As the divine names of Earth guide our actions, we learn to live in harmony with the natural rhythms of life. We learn the value of patience, of resilience, of nurturing growth. We learn to tread lightly on the Earth, to respect its sacredness, to see the divine in every grain of sand, every blade of grass, every drop of water.<br><br>
              Yet, Earth is not just about nurturing growth, but also about embracing change. For it is in the heart of Earth that seeds die to be reborn as trees. It is here that the old gives way to the new, that decay turns into life. The divine names associated with Earth teach us to embrace this cycle of life and death, of growth and decay, reminding us that every end is but a new beginning.<br><br>
              As we journey through the realm of Earth, let us not forget the lessons learned in the realms of Fire and Air. Let us carry with us the wisdom of the divine names, using it to shape our actions, to guide our steps, to light our path. But remember, dear reader, the journey does not end here. For beyond the realm of Earth, awaits the realm of Water, where we will learn to flow with the rhythms of life, to surrender to the divine will, to dive into the depths of spiritual understanding. Let us continue our journey, for the divine covenant awaits our fulfillment.<br><br>

            <div class="row">
              <p class="lead"><b>XI. The Water of Divine Compassion</b></p>
              <p>And so, dear reader, we arrive at the element of Water, the source of life, the essence of purification, the wellspring of compassion. Water, the most mutable of elements, signifies the divine names associated with empathy, cleansing, and the vital energies that sustain life itself. Much like the gentle caress of a river carving its course through the landscape, the divine names associated with Water sculpt our hearts, pouring into them the nectar of compassion and love.<br><br>
              In the grand drama of existence, the divine names of Water teach us to play our part with kindness, to view each character not as a mere object, but as a being of immense worth. They urge us to cherish the sacred thread of life that connects us all, reminding us of the profound truth that we are all drops in the vast ocean of existence.<br><br>
              The waters of divine compassion cleanse us, washing away the grime of ego and prejudice, leaving behind a heart that mirrors the purity of the divine. They nourish us, quenching the thirst of our souls, filling us with a sense of belonging, of connection, of unity with all of creation.<br><br>
              As we journey through the realm of Water, let us allow its divine names to shape us, to guide us, to transform us. Let us learn to flow like water, to adapt, to change, to overcome obstacles with grace and patience. Let us learn to reflect the divine attributes in our thoughts, our words, our actions.<br><br>
              But remember, dear reader, this journey through the elements is not an end in itself. It is a means to a greater end - the fulfillment of our divine covenant. And so, as we leave the realm of Water, we carry with us the wisdom of the divine names, the understanding gleaned from the elements, ready to face the final test - the test of Divine Kingship. Let us proceed with courage, for the path of the divine covenant awaits our footsteps.<br><br>

              <p class="lead"><b>XII. Conclusion: The Journey Towards Fulfillment</b></p>
              <p>And thus, dear reader, we come to the culmination of our musings on the covenant and the Deen al-Fitrah. Our journey has been one that has led us through the corridors of understanding, into the heart of divine wisdom. It is here, at the nexus of divine covenant and human consciousness, that we uncover the profound equation that governs our existence: Validity + Truth = Soundness. A simple formula, perhaps, but one laden with profound implications.<br><br>
              A. Validity: The Universal Laws of Energy (The metaphyscis)<br><br>
              We have traversed the terrain of metaphysics, seeking to comprehend the fabric of reality itself. We have discovered that reality is an orchestra of energies, a symphony of divine names - the Asma ul Husna. The verses of the Quran, specifically the covenant of 7:172 and its performance of contract in 7:179-181, instruct us to uncover the true meaning of these energies, these divine attributes.<br><br>
              B. Truth: Surah 103 (The Epistemology)<br><br>
              The second part of our divine covenant lies in the epistemology of Surah 103. It calls upon us to align our nature with the universal laws of energy, to build a community rooted in natural law, ecological spirituality, and mutual aid. We are guided towards a world legal system, a common law court rooted in the principles of mutual credit and time banking. This is the jihad against the system of monetary slavery, the pursuit of a society bound by mutual aid networks. Our success in implementing these principles of validity and truth identifies us as Rasul, as per verses 10:47 and 2:151.<br><br>
              C. Usefulness - The Divine Kingship (The Axiology - Common Law & The Gift Economy)<br><br>
              The third and final part of our divine covenant resides in the Divine Kingship as detailed in verses 2:30, 21:105, and 24:55. It concerns itself with the establishment of a system of governance, a Green State guided by the axiological justice system of verses 4:64-65. Our guiding principles are the Global Charter of Ecospirituality (Verse 60:9), and the alignment of society with nature, tawbatan nasoohan (Verses 7:156-158). The major premises of Taqwa, Zakat, and complete obedience to the Earth Jurist, combined with belief in our signs, form the bedrock of this final part.<br><br>
              The journey towards fulfilling our divine covenant, dear reader, is a path of transformation. It calls upon us to wrestle with profound truths, to align ourselves with the divine names, and to embrace the wisdom of the universe. This journey shapes us, moulds us into beings capable of wisdom, love, and profound understanding. It guides us towards our divine potential, towards the fulfilment of our purpose as humans.<br><br>
              As we draw to a close, let us remember that the journey towards fulfilling our divine covenant is not merely a journey of understanding the divine names. It is a journey of self-discovery, a journey towards understanding our true selves, towards uncovering our divine potential. So, let us embark on this journey with courage, with determination, and with an unwavering faith in our divine potential. For this is the journey that makes us truly human, the journey that defines our very existence.<br><br>

                <p class="lead"><b>XIII: The Path Forward: Journeying Towards Understanding</b></p>
                <p>And so, dear reader, the road forward lies aglow with the prospect of enlightenment. To continue the journey, to follow the path we have begun, is to embrace a life of fulfillment, of spiritual growth and transformation.<br><br>
                But bear in mind, it is not a path for the faint of heart. No, it requires a stout spirit, a bold determination, and a heart ever open to wisdom. It is a path that asks us to embrace the divine names in all their complexity, to see the world not as a mere physical construct but as a divine tapestry woven from the threads of spiritual consciousness.<br><br>
                We are called to explore the vast landscape of the divine, to immerse ourselves in the universal laws of energy, to seek out the profound truths hidden within the verses of the Quran. We are called to build a community bound by mutual aid, rooted in the principles of the gift economy, and guided by the laws of natural selection. And we are called to establish a system of governance that reflects our spiritual understanding, a system that upholds the principles of justice, compassion, and respect for all life.<br><br>
                This journey, while demanding, is a journey of incredible reward. It is a journey that brings us closer to our divine potential, that helps us uncover the profound truths of our existence. And it is a journey that transforms us, that moulds us into beings of wisdom, love, and understanding.<br><br>
                So, as we step forward into the future, let us hold fast to our divine covenant. Let us strive to understand the divine names, to uphold the principles of truth and justice, and to live in harmony with the universal laws of energy. And let us do so with courage, with determination, and with an unwavering faith in our divine potential.<br><br>
                For this, dear reader, is our path forward. This is our journey towards understanding, our journey towards fulfilling our divine covenant. This is the journey that defines us, that makes us truly human. And so, as we embark on this journey, let us do so with hearts full of hope, with minds open to wisdom, and with spirits ever eager for enlightenment.<br><br>
                And thus, dear reader, we come to the end of our discourse. We have journeyed together through the realms of understanding, explored the depths of divine wisdom, and sought to uncover the profound truths of our existence. But the journey does not end here. No, it is only the beginning. For the path to understanding, to fulfillment, is a lifelong journey. It is a journey that we must continue to embark on, day after day, with courage, determination, and an unwavering faith in our divine potential. It is the journey that makes us truly human, the journey that defines our very existence.<br><br>
