          <p>Amidst the mounting environmental, social, and spiritual challenges that besiege humanity, a unifying framework is desperately needed - one that addresses these concerns in a comprehensive and holistic manner. Surah 103, renowned as Al-Asr, provides invaluable insight into the essence of human experience, emphasizing the significance of faith, good deeds, truth, and patience. Drawing inspiration from these timeless principles, the ecospirituality, religious naturalism, and spiritual naturalism movements have united in a collaborative effort to establish a Vision, Mission, Objectives, Strategies, and Action Plans (VMOSA) - a guiding light that illuminates the path towards a more harmonious and sustainable future.<br><br>
          At the core of this VMOSA lies the Naturalist Constitution - a sacred covenant that upholds the principles of natural law, the protection of minority rights, and the preservation of the naturalistic way of life. This article shall delve into the fundamental tenets of the Naturalist Constitution, explore the epic struggle between the Children of Adam and the Prince of Darkness, and demonstrate how the VMOSA, invigorated by the wisdom of Surah 103, can lead humanity towards spiritual and ecological concord.<br><br></p>

              <p class="lead"><b>The Quranic Principles of Natural Law and Constitutionalism</b></p>
              <p>Synopsis: In this article, the author explores how the Quran emphasizes natural law and constitutional principles as the basis for a just society. The article focuses on Surah 103 and other verses that provide guidance for humanity, and argues that the Quran and Surah 103 offer a constitutional framework for a just society. The article also discusses the adaptability of Quranic principles to modern societies and refutes counterarguments against their application. Through the reflection and promotion of the Quran's guidance and values, the author argues that we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society.<br><br>
              It was a time of both prosperity and turmoil. A time when societies were searching for guidance on how to create a just and equitable society. And in this search, the Quran, a holy scripture that has been guiding humanity for centuries, has emerged as a surprising source of wisdom.<br><br>
              The Quran, with its emphasis on natural law and constitutional principles, serves as the foundation for true Islamic jurisprudence, specifically the Natural Law (Common Law) School of Jurisprudence. Despite ongoing debates on how to apply Quranic principles in modern societies, the Quran's guidance remains universally relevant for creating a just society.<br><br>
              At the heart of this argument is Surah 103 (Al-Asr), which provides guidance for humanity, as do verses 75:19, 11:17, 3:64/5:68, and 60:9. The establishment of constitutional principles of Surah 103, the establishment of the Natural Law (Common Law World Legal System), and the establishment of a community of One Nation based on Surah 103 are the three major points that support the thesis statement.<br><br>
              The Quran's historical role as a source of legal and moral guidance for the Universal Law (the Think & Grow Rich Principles) is well-documented. Notable mathematical and scientific scholars have interpreted Surah 103, as have other scholars who have researched constitutional principles in Islamic jurisprudence from the Quran-only texts based on the Deen al-Fitrah/Nature. The 2016 Conference on Sunni Islam in Grozny was convened to define the term "Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama'ah according to this principles. Quranic principles have evolved over time and are adaptable to modern societies.<br><br>
              IMAN, AMAL, and NATURAL LAW are essential concepts in the Quran. Quranic principles are related to constitutionalism through the Law of Trust. Different perspectives on Quranic interpretation exist, including the secularianist from the Muslim Theism and Muslim Secularism sects. Quranic principles serve as the foundation for just societies through Deen al-Fitrah/Nature.<br><br>
              The evidence supporting these major points includes Quranic verses on the true interpretation/premises of Iman and Amal from the Quran-only texts and Deen al-Fitrah/Nature, historical examples of societies guided by these principles, and expert opinions on the significance of Iman and Amal. Detailed analysis of Surah 103 and the Schools of Jurisprudence, examples of School of Jurisprudence derived from Surah 103, expert opinions on Natural Law and the Quran, and Quranic guidance on establishing a community of One Nation based on Iman and Amal and expert opinions on the importance of community in Islam.<br><br>
              In addition to the major premises, the minor premises include the mission of the Divine Kingship, the mission of the Natural Law School of Jurisprudence, and the mission of the Gift Economics monetary system for combating the Riba/Cronyism and Fractional Reserve Banking monetary system. Successful implementation of ONE NATION principles includes the sustainability characters of the Green State, Ecospirituality or Anarchism (based on the atomic principles), the disruptive characters of the Taghut State (the star, moon, and sun: The Law & Economic School of Jurisprudence (capitalist), The Sociological/Historical School of Jurisprudence (religism) and the Analytical School of Jurisprudence (the monopolist or statist)), and the importance of Surah 103 in establishing a constitutional framework for a just society.<br><br>
              Of course, there are anticipated counterarguments and objections to the thesis statement, including concerns about the compatibility of Quranic principles with modern societies and critiques on the interpretation of Surah 103 and its relevance. The need to address misconceptions about the Quran and its principles and concerns about the application of Quranic principles in contemporary societies is significant.<br><br>
              However, these counterarguments can be refuted using evidence and logic. The adaptability and applicability of Quranic principles to modern societies can be demonstrated through the recognition of their universal nature. It is important to acknowledge and address the concerns raised by counterarguments, as they reflect valid perspectives (half truth and cherry picking) that need to be taken into consideration when applying Quranic principles to contemporary societies.<br><br>
              For instance, some may argue that the implementation of Quranic principles in modern societies may be challenging due to cultural differences and varying societal values. However, it is essential to recognize that Quranic principles are universal and adaptable, and can be applied in a way that is compatible with different cultures and values. The Quran emphasizes the importance of justice, equality, and compassion, which are values that can be universally accepted and applied.<br><br>
              Others may argue that the interpretation of Surah 103 and its relevance to modern society is open to debate and subjective interpretation. However, Surah 103 provides a clear framework for a just society based on natural law and constitutional principles, which can be applied universally. Quranic principles have been interpreted and applied by notable scholars throughout history, demonstrating their relevance and adaptability to different times and places.<br><br>

              <p class="lead"><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
              <p>The Quran and Surah 103 provide a constitutional framework for a just society. The principles of Iman and Amal, natural law, and the establishment of a community based on Surah 103 are supported by evidence and examples, and demonstrate the adaptability and applicability of Quranic principles to modern societies, as well as the relevance and significance of Surah 103 in establishing a just society. It is essential to address counterarguments and objections to the thesis statement through logical reasoning, and the recognition of the universal nature of Quranic guidance. By reflecting on the Quran's guidance and promoting its values, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society that embodies the principles of natural law and constitutionalism.<br><br>

              <p class="lead"><b>Understanding IF-THEN-ELSE Principles in the Quran</b></p>
              <p>God exists since mathematics is consistent, and the Devil exists since we cannot prove it!<br><br>
              Synopsis: The Quran is a religious text that provides guidance on various aspects of life. It contains principles that are relevant even in modern times, including the IF-THEN-ELSE principles. These principles are derived from verses in the Quran that suggest that if certain conditions are met, then specific outcomes will follow, and if those conditions are not met, then different outcomes will occur. This article explores some of the key verses in the Quran that explain these principles and their application to our daily lives. By understanding these principles, we can make better decisions and improve our overall well-being.<br><br>
              The Quran is a book of guidance for Muslims around the world, and it contains many teachings and principles that are still relevant today. One such principle is the IF THEN ELSE statement, which is a logical construct used in programming languages to create conditional statements.<br><br>
              In the Quran, this principle is used to explain the consequences of certain actions or beliefs. The verse 4:82 states that if the Quran was not from Allah, there would be many discrepancies in it. This verse suggests that if someone claims to be a prophet and his teachings contradict the Quran, then his claims must be false.<br><br>
              The major premise of the Quran is that if universal laws of time have passed, then mankind is in loss unless they meet certain conditions. These conditions are defined in the minor premises, which are based on specific verses from the Quran.<br><br>
              For example, the first minor premise is based on the verse 64:8 and states that if a person believes in nature, specifically Allah, Rasul, and Light, then they are meeting the first condition. Similarly, the second minor premise is based on the verses 4:64-65 and 7:156-158, and states that if a person does righteous deeds, then they are meeting the second condition.<br><br>
              The third minor premise is based on the verses 60:9 and 58:22 and states that if a person enjoins a community, then they are meeting the third condition. The fourth minor premise is based on the verses 75:19, 11:17, and 4:82 and states that if a person enjoins to truth and common law, then they are meeting the fourth condition.<br><br>
              Lastly, the fifth minor premise is based on the verses 28:83, 90:11-18, and 2:279 and states that if a person enjoins to patience, gift economy, and community, then they are meeting the fifth condition.<br><br>
              If a person meets all of these conditions, then the major premise suggests that they are not in loss, and if they do not meet these conditions, then they are in loss. This principle is a reminder to Muslims that they must follow the teachings of the Quran and do good deeds in order to be successful in this life and the next.<br><br>
              In conclusion, the Quran uses the IF THEN ELSE principle to explain the consequences of certain actions or beliefs. The major premise states that if universal laws of time have passed, then mankind is in loss unless they meet certain conditions. These conditions are defined in the minor premises, which are based on specific verses from the Quran. By following these teachings, Muslims can lead a successful life and achieve salvation in the hereafter.<br><br>
